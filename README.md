# Housing-market-analysis - finished 23/04/2020

In this notebook, you'll find some R code analysing a fictionnal housing market from Kaggle
This project was done during my last year of engineering degree.  
The purpose was to analyse a dataset - whichever we wanted to - with multiple mathematical tools.  
Data vizualisation was first requested for a better understanding of the data.
Then, some classical regression and comparaison between techniques such as least square (forward, backard and stepwise) and maximum likelyhood.
Finaly, some tests in order to verify the results of the previously used models.
